# 🚀 Project Mission

## Core Philosophy

`hy-home-learned` is not just a repository; it is a **Personal Knowledge Operating System**. It is designed to act as an "exocortex" – an external extension of the user's mind, enhanced by AI agents to handle organization, governance, and synthesis of information.

The primary goal is to transition from **passive consumption** of information to **active construction** of knowledge.

## 🔭 Vision 2026

By the end of 2026, this workspace aims to be:

1. **A Massive Structured Knowledge Base**: Containing verified, executable examples across Python, Cloud, and AI domains.
2. **An Autonomous Research Lab**: Where AI agents can independently read documentation, try experiments, and report back findings.
3. **A Production-Grade Boilerplate**: Serving as the "Gold Standard" source for starting new projects with pre-configured best practices.

## 🎯 Strategic Objectives

### 1. High-Fidelity Learning (TIL)

- "Today I Learned" nodes must not be fleeting notes.
- They must be **atomic**, **linked**, and whenever possible, **executable**.
- Focus on "Deep Work" concepts rather than surface-level definitions.

### 2. Radical Standardization

- Every line of code and markdown usually follows a defined standard.
- We trade speed for **consistency** and **maintainability**.
- Governance is automated via `ruff`, `mypy`, and AI agent protocols.

### 3. AI-Human Symbiosis

- Humans provide the **Direction** and **Insight**.
- Agents provide the **Structure**, **Verification**, and **Scale**.
- Interactions are codified in `docs/agent-protocols.md`.
