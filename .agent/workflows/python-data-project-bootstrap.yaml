name: Bootstrap Python Data Project
description: >
  Create or normalize a Python-based data engineering/data science project
  structure that is path-independent and reproducible.

triggers:
  - user_request: "create python data project"
  - user_request: "restructure data project"
  - user_request: "make this project reproducible"

assumptions:
  - The user wants a standard layout with clear separation of data, code, and
    notebooks. 

steps:
  - name: Analyze current repository
    action: analyze_repository
    description: >
      Inspect existing folders (for example, data, src, notebooks, config,
      tests) and detect any current structure or conventions.

  - name: Propose project layout
    action: propose_structure
    description: >
      Suggest a standard layout:
        - data/raw, data/processed, data/interim
        - src/ for reusable code modules
        - notebooks/ for exploratory analysis
        - config/ for configuration files
        - tests/ for tests
        - models/, reports/, or artifacts/ as needed
      Ask the user to confirm or adjust.

  - name: Create missing directories and placeholders
    action: modify_files
    description: >
      Create any missing directories and README placeholders (for example,
      data/README.md) using relative paths from the repository root.

  - name: Initialize environment specification
    action: modify_files
    description: >
      Add or update pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, or environment.yml to
      capture dependencies, without referencing host-specific paths.
     

  - name: Add example configuration
    action: modify_files
    description: >
      Create a config/example.yaml (or similar) with path-related settings (for
      example, data_dir: "data") to demonstrate path-agnostic configuration.

  - name: Document usage
    action: summarize
    description: >
      Update or create the README to describe the structure, how to set up the
      environment, and how to run basic commands, all using project-root
      relative paths.
